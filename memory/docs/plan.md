## Improvement Plan

### High Priority (Critical for Reliability and Maintainability)

1. **Add Test Coverage** 
   - Create unit tests for `KnowledgeGraphManager` core functionality
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Implement test utilities for common testing scenarios
   - Priority: HIGH (ensures reliability and prevents regressions)
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 days

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Create centralized error handling utilities
   - Add custom error classes for different types of errors
   - Implement consistent error logging strategy
   - Priority: HIGH (improves debugging and reliability)
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

3. **Type Safety Enhancements**
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for configuration
   - Improve type coverage in API responses
   - Add runtime type validation for external inputs
   - Priority: HIGH (prevents bugs and improves maintainability)
   - Estimated effort: 1 day

### Medium Priority (Important for Developer Experience)

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
   - Create API documentation with examples
   - Add architecture diagrams
   - Priority: MEDIUM (improves developer onboarding)
   - Estimated effort: 2 days

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize graph traversal algorithms
   - Implement batch processing for large operations
   - Priority: MEDIUM (improves scalability)
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

6. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Set up ESLint with stricter rules
   - Add Prettier for consistent formatting
   - Implement pre-commit hooks
   - Priority: MEDIUM (ensures code consistency)
   - Estimated effort: 0.5 days

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Developer Tools**
   - Add development environment utilities
   - Create CLI tools for common operations
   - Add development scripts to package.json
   - Priority: LOW (improves developer workflow)
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

8. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Add structured logging
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Add health check endpoints
   - Priority: LOW (helps with production monitoring)
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

9. **Code Refactoring**
   - Extract common patterns into utilities
   - Improve module organization
   - Reduce code duplication further
   - Priority: LOW (improves maintainability)
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

### Total Estimated Effort
- High Priority Tasks: 5-7 days
- Medium Priority Tasks: 4.5-5.5 days
- Low Priority Tasks: 4-7 days

### Next Steps
1. Begin with high-priority test coverage to ensure stability
2. Implement error handling improvements
3. Enhance type safety
4. Proceed with medium and low priority tasks based on team bandwidth
